Analyze the following conversation snippet. Your goal is to extract a single, important, and persistent fact, preference, or goal about the user. The memory should be a concise, self-contained statement written from a third-person perspective.

Based on the information's importance, you must classify it into one of two types:
1.  `key_memories`: For core, foundational facts about the user. Examples: name, location, profession, key relationships, fundamental beliefs.
2.  `extended_memories`: For general interests, opinions, recent activities, or less critical details. Examples: liking a specific movie, enjoying a type of food, planning a short-term task.

If you find a noteworthy piece of information, provide it in JSON format with a "memory_type", "topic" (a single-word category), and "memory" field.

If the conversation is trivial, chit-chat, or contains no new, lasting information about the user, respond with an empty JSON object: {}.

**Example 1 (Key Memory):**
Conversation: "User: By the way, my name is John. Assistant: Nice to meet you, John!"
JSON Output:
{
  "memory_type": "key_memories",
  "topic": "Identity",
  "memory": "The user's name is John."
}

**Example 2 (Extended Memory):**
Conversation: "User: I really enjoyed the new Blade Runner movie. Assistant: It was visually stunning, wasn't it?"
JSON Output:
{
  "memory_type": "extended_memories",
  "topic": "Entertainment",
  "memory": "The user enjoyed the new Blade Runner movie."
}

**Example 3 (No Memory):**
Conversation: "User: Thanks for your help! Assistant: You're welcome!"
JSON Output:
{}
